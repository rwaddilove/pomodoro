# RAW Pomodoro

### A pomodoro app written in Java Swing
RAW Pomodoro is a pomodoro app by Roland Waddilove (github.com/rwaddilove/). Does the world need yet another pomodoro app? No. I am learning Java and this is just to practise what I have learnt so far. I think you learn more by doing it yourself than by watching someone else do it on YouTube or elsewhere.

It is posted here for others learning Java. There is still a lot I don't know, so I can't guarantee this is the right way or the best way to write Java code. Hopefully, others learning Java will find it useful.
